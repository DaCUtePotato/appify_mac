# Appify
## Brief Introduction?
Appify is quick and easy cli to sign your mac apps locally. 
Ever had the problem that a shady app you just downloaded from a weird, 10-yo website doesn't get executed because your mac thinks it isn't verified and deems it unsafe? Fear no more for I have a solution: *drumroll* **appify!!** *victory music*. 

## Installation
Downlad the sh file and run
```
chmod +x path_to_the_sh
```
After that you can remove the sh extension and move it to your bin folder (usr/local/bin). You will need admin for this. Alternatively you can make a custom bin folder and move it there. 

## Usage
After the installation, you can run applify in your terminal now! Its usage is as follows:
```
appify path_to_your_.app_file
```
after that your mac should be signing the application and unless it's broken, it can be launched now :D

**Note that some apps are unsafe and may harm your computer or compromize your security. I am not responsible for any kinds of damage.**
